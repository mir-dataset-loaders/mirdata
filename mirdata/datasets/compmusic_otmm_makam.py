"""OTMM Makam Recognition Dataset Loader

.. admonition:: Dataset Info
    :class: dropdown

    **NOTE**: From mirdata v0.3.8 on, the only version available of this dataset is dlfm2016-fix1, which is
    basically the same as dlfm2016, but with a few fixes in some annotations. The original dlfm2016 version
    is still available in mirdata versions <=0.3.7. Note that from dlfm2016 to dlfm2016-fix1, no new recordings
    or annotation were added, only a few annotation files were fixed.

    This dataset is designed to test makam recognition methodologies on Ottoman-Turkish makam music.
    It is composed of 50 recording from each of the 20 most common makams in CompMusic Project's Dunya Ottoman-Turkish
    Makam Music collection. Currently the dataset is the largest makam recognition dataset.

    The recordings are selected from commercial recordings carefully such that they cover diverse musical forms,
    vocal/instrumentation settings and recording qualities (e.g. historical recordings vs. contemporary recordings).
    Each recording in the dataset is identified by an 16-character long unique identifier called MBID, hosted in
    MusicBrainz. The makam and the tonic of each recording is annotated in the file annotations.json.

    The audio related data in the test dataset is organized by each makam in the folder data. Due to copyright reasons,
    we are unable to distribute the audio. Instead we provide the predominant melody of each recording, computed by a
    state-of-the-art predominant melody extraction algorithm optimized for OTMM culture. These features are saved as
    text files (with the paths data/[makam]/[mbid].pitch) of single column that contains the frequency values. The
    timestamps are removed to reduce the filesizes. The step size of the pitch track is 0.0029 seconds (an analysis
    window of 128 sample hop size of an mp3 with 44100 Hz sample rate), with which one can recompute the timestamps of
    samples.

    Moreover the metadata of each recording is available in the repository, crawled from MusicBrainz using an open
    source tool developed by us. The metadata files are saved as data/[makam]/[mbid].json.

    For reproducability purposes we note the version of all tools we have used to generate this dataset in the
    file algorithms.json (not integrated in the loader but present in the donwloaded dataset).

    A complementary toolbox for this dataset is MORTY, which is a mode recogition and tonic identification toolbox.
    It can be used and optimized for any modal music culture. Further details are explained in the publication above.
