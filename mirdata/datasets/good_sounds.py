.. admonition:: Dataset Info
    :class: dropdown

    The Good-Sounds dataset is born of the collaboration between the Music Technology Group and Korg. Good-Sounds
    [2, 16] is carried out recording a training dataset of single note excerpts including six classes of sounds per
    studied instrument. Twelve different instruments are recorded, as is shown in Table 2. For each instrument,
    the complete range of playable semitones is captured several times with various tonal characteristics. There
    are two classes: Good and Bad sounds. Bad sounds are divided into five sub-classes, one for each musical dimension
    stated by the expert musicians. Bad sounds are composed by examples of note recordings
    that are intentionally badly played. The last class includes examples of note recordings that are considered to
    be well played.

    This dataset was created in the context of the Pablo project, partially funded by KORG Inc. It contains monophonic
    recordings of two kind of exercises: single notes and scales.
    The recordings were made in the Universitat Pompeu Fabra / Phonos recording studio by 15 different professional
    musicians, all of them holding a music degree and having some expertise in teaching. 12 different instruments were
    recorded using one or up to 4 different microphones (depending on the recording session). For all the instruments
    the whole set of playable semitones in the instrument is recorded several times with different tonal characteristics.
    Each note is recorded into a separate mono .flac audio file of 48kHz and 32 bits. The tonal characteristics are
    explained both in the the following section and the related publication. The database is meant for organizing the
    sounds in a handy way. It is organised in four different entities: sounds, takes, packs and ratings.
