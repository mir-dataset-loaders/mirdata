Installing mirdata for development purposes
###########################################

To install ``mirdata`` for development purposes:

    - First run:

    .. code-block:: console

        git clone https://github.com/mir-dataset-loaders/mirdata.git

    - Then, after opening source data library you have to install the dependencies for updating the documentation
      and running tests:

    .. code-block:: console

        pip install .
        pip install .[tests]
        pip install .[docs]
        pip install .[dali]


We recommend to install `pyenv <https://github.com/pyenv/pyenv#installation>`_ to manage your Python versions
and install all ``mirdata`` requirements. You will want to install the latest versions of Python 3.6 and 3.7.
Once ``pyenv`` and the Python versions are configured, install ``pytest``. Make sure you installed all the pytest
plugins to automatically test your code successfully. Finally, run:

.. code-block:: bash

    pytest tests/ --local


All tests should pass!


Writing a new dataset loader
#############################


The steps to add a new dataset loader to ``mirdata`` are:

1. `Create an index <create_index_>`_
2. `Create a module <create_module_>`_
3. `Add tests <add_tests_>`_
4. `Submit your loader <submit_loader_>`_

**Before starting**, if your dataset **is not fully downloadable** you should:


1. Contact the mirdata team by opening an issue or PR so we can discuss how to proceed with the closed dataset.
2. Show that the version used to create the checksum is the "canonical" one, either by getting the version from the 
   dataset creator, or by verifying equivalence with several other copies of the dataset.

To reduce friction, we will make commits on top of contributors PRs by default unless
the ``please-do-not-edit`` flag is used.

.. _create_index:

1. Create an index
------------------

``mirdata``'s structure relies on `indexes`. Indexes are dictionaries contain information about the structure of the
dataset which is necessary for the loading and validating functionalities of ``mirdata``. In particular, indexes contain
information about the files included in the dataset, their location and checksums. The necessary steps are:

1. To create an index, first cereate a script in ``scripts/``, as ``make_dataset_index.py``, which generates an index file.
2. Then run the script on the :ref:`canonical version` of the dataset and save the index in ``mirdata/datasets/indexes/`` as ``dataset_index.json``.


.. _index example:

Here there is an example of an index to use as guideline:

.. admonition:: Example Make Index Script
    :class: dropdown

    .. literalinclude:: contributing_examples/make_example_index.py
        :language: python

More examples of scripts used to create dataset indexes can be found in the `scripts <https://github.com/mir-dataset-loaders/mirdata/tree/master/scripts>`_ folder.

tracks
^^^^^^

Most MIR datasets are organized as a collection of tracks and annotations. In such case, the index should make use of the ``tracks``
top-level key. A dictionary should be stored under the ``tracks`` top-level key where the keys are the unique track ids of the dataset. 
The values are a dictionary of files associated with a track id, along with their checksums. These files can be for instance audio files 
or annotations related to the track id. File paths are relative to the top level directory of a dataset.

.. admonition:: Index Examples - Tracks
    :class: dropdown

    If the version `1.0` of a given dataset has the structure:

    .. code-block:: javascript

        > Example_Dataset/
            > audio/
                track1.wav
                track2.wav
                track3.wav
            > annotations/
                track1.csv
                Track2.csv
                track3.csv
            > metadata/
                metadata_file.csv

    The top level directory is ``Example_Dataset`` and the relative path for ``track1.wav``
    would be ``audio/track1.wav``. Any unavailable fields are indicated with `null`. A possible index file for this example would be:

    .. code-block:: javascript


        {   "version": "1.0",
            "tracks":
                "track1": {
                    "audio": [
                        "audio/track1.wav",  // the relative path for track1's audio file
                        "912ec803b2ce49e4a541068d495ab570"  // track1.wav's md5 checksum
                    ],
                    "annotation": [
                        "annotations/track1.csv",  // the relative path for track1's annotation
                        "2cf33591c3b28b382668952e236cccd5"  // track1.csv's md5 checksum
                    ]
                },
                "track2": {
                    "audio": [
                        "audio/track2.wav",
                        "65d671ec9787b32cfb7e33188be32ff7"
                    ],
                    "annotation": [
                        "annotations/Track2.csv",
                        "e1964798cfe86e914af895f8d0291812"
                    ]
                },
                "track3": {
                    "audio": [
                        "audio/track3.wav",
                        "60edeb51dc4041c47c031c4bfb456b76"
                    ],
                    "annotation": [
                        "annotations/track3.csv",
                        "06cb006cc7b61de6be6361ff904654b3"
                    ]
                },
            }
        "metadata": {
                "metadata_file": [
                    "metadata/metadata_file.csv",
                    "7a41b280c7b74e2ddac5184708f9525b"
                ]
        }
        }


    .. note::
        In this example there is a (purposeful) mismatch between the name of the audio file ``track2.wav`` and its corresponding annotation file, ``Track2.csv``, compared with the other pairs. This mismatch should be included in the index. This type of slight difference in filenames happens often in publicly available datasets, making pairing audio and annotation files more difficult. We use a fixed, version-controlled index to account for this kind of mismatch, rather than relying on string parsing on load.


multitracks
^^^^^^^^^^^

.. admonition:: Index Examples - Multitracks
    :class: dropdown, warning
    
 If the version `1.0` of a given multitrack dataset has the structure:

    .. code-block:: javascript

        > Example_Dataset/
            > audio/
                multitrack1-voice1.wav
                multitrack1-voice2.wav
                multitrack1-accompaniment.wav
                multitrack1-mix.wav
                multitrack2-voice1.wav
                multitrack2-voice2.wav
                multitrack2-accompaniment.wav
                multitrack2-mix.wav
            > annotations/
                multitrack1-voice-f0.csv
                multitrack2-voice-f0.csv
                multitrack1-f0.csv
                multitrack2-f0.csv
            > metadata/
                metadata_file.csv

    The top level directory is ``Example_Dataset`` and the relative path for ``multitrack1-voice1``
    would be ``audio/multitrack1-voice1.wav``. Any unavailable fields are indicated with `null`. A possible index file for this example would be:
    
.. code-block:: javascript

    { 
        "version": 1,
        "tracks": {
            "multitrack1-voice": {
                "audio_voice1": ('audio/multitrack1-voice1.wav', checksum), 
                "audio_voice2": ('audio/multitrack1-voice1.wav', checksum),  
                "voice-f0": ('annotations/multitrack1-voice-f0.csv', checksum)
            }
            "multitrack1-accompaniment": {
                "audio_accompaniment": ('audio/multitrack1-accompaniment.wav', checksum)
            }
            "multitrack2-voice" : {...}
            ...
        },
        "multitracks": {
            "multitrack1": {
                "tracks": ['multitrack1-voice', 'multitrack1-accompaniment'],    
                "audio": ('audio/multitrack1-mix.wav', checksum)
                "f0": ('annotations/multitrack1-f0.csv', checksum)
            }
            "multitrack2": ...
        },
        "metadata": {
            "metadata_file": [
                "metadata/metadata_file.csv",
                "7a41b280c7b74e2ddac5184708f9525b"
                ]
        }
    }
  
Note that in this examples we group ``audio_voice1`` and ``audio_voice2`` in a single Track because the annotation ``voice-f0`` annotation corresponds to their mixture. In contrast, the annotation ``voice-f0`` is extracted from the multitrack mix and it is stored in the ``multitracks`` group. The multitrack ``multitrack1`` has an additional track ``multitrack1-mix.wav`` which may be the master track, the final mix, the recording of ``multitrack1`` with another microphone.

.. _create_module:

2. Create a module
------------------

Once the index is created you can create the loader. For that, we suggest you use the following template and adjust it for your dataset.
To quickstart a new module:

1. Copy the example below and save it to ``mirdata/datasets/<your_dataset_name>.py``
2. Find & Replace ``Example`` with the <your_dataset_name>.
3. Remove any lines beginning with `# --` which are there as guidelines. 

.. admonition:: Example Module
    :class: dropdown

    .. literalinclude:: contributing_examples/example.py
        :language: python

You may find these examples useful as references:

* `A simple, fully downloadable dataset <https://github.com/mir-dataset-loaders/mirdata/blob/master/mirdata/datasets/tinysol.py>`_
* `A dataset which is partially downloadable <https://github.com/mir-dataset-loaders/mirdata/blob/master/mirdata/datasets/beatles.py>`_
* `A dataset with restricted access data <https://github.com/mir-dataset-loaders/mirdata/blob/master/mirdata/datasets/medleydb_melody.py#L33>`_
* `A dataset which uses dataset-level metadata <https://github.com/mir-dataset-loaders/mirdata/blob/master/mirdata/datasets/tinysol.py#L114>`_
* `A dataset which does not use dataset-level metadata <https://github.com/mir-dataset-loaders/mirdata/blob/master/mirdata/datasets/gtzan_genre.py#L36>`_
* `A dataset with a custom download function <https://github.com/mir-dataset-loaders/mirdata/blob/master/mirdata/datasets/maestro.py#L257>`_
* `A dataset with a remote index <https://github.com/mir-dataset-loaders/mirdata/blob/master/mirdata/datasets/acousticbrainz_genre.py>`_

For many more examples, see the `datasets folder <https://github.com/mir-dataset-loaders/mirdata/tree/master/mirdata/datasets>`_.


.. _add_tests:

3. Add tests
------------

To finish your contribution, include tests that check the integrity of your loader. For this, follow these steps:

1. Make a toy version of the dataset in the tests folder ``tests/resources/mir_datasets/my_dataset/``,
   so you can test against little data. For example:

    * Include all audio and annotation files for one track of the dataset
    * For each audio/annotation file, reduce the audio length to 1-2 seconds and remove all but a few of the annotations.
    * If the dataset has a metadata file, reduce the length to a few lines.

2. Test all of the dataset specific code, e.g. the public attributes of the Track class, the load functions and any other 
   custom functions you wrote. See the `tests folder <https://github.com/mir-dataset-loaders/mirdata/tree/master/tests>`_ for reference.
   If your loader has a custom download function, add tests similar to 
   `this loader <https://github.com/mir-dataset-loaders/mirdata/blob/master/tests/test_groove_midi.py#L96>`_.
3. Locally run ``pytest -s tests/test_full_dataset.py --local --dataset my_dataset`` before submitting your loader to make 
   sure everything is working.


.. note::  We have written automated tests for all loader's ``cite``, ``download``, ``validate``, ``load``, ``track_ids`` functions, 
           as well as some basic edge cases of the ``Track`` class, so you don't need to write tests for these!


.. _test_file:

.. admonition:: Example Test File
    :class: dropdown

    .. literalinclude:: contributing_examples/test_example.py
        :language: python


Running your tests locally
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Before creating a PR, you should run all the tests locally like this:

::

    pytest tests/ --local


The `--local` flag skips tests that are built to run only on the remote testing environment.

To run one specific test file:

::

    pytest tests/test_ikala.py


Finally, there is one local test you should run, which we can't easily run in our testing environment.

::

    pytest -s tests/test_full_dataset.py --local --dataset dataset


Where ``dataset`` is the name of the module of the dataset you added. The ``-s`` tells pytest not to skip print 
statments, which is useful here for seeing the download progress bar when testing the download function.

This tests that your dataset downloads, validates, and loads properly for every track. This test takes a long time 
for some datasets, but it's important to ensure the integrity of the library.

We've added one extra convenience flag for this test, for getting the tests running when the download is very slow:

::

    pytest -s tests/test_full_dataset.py --local --dataset my_dataset --skip-download


which will skip the downloading step. Note that this is just for convenience during debugging - the tests should eventually all pass without this flag.

.. _working_big_datasets:

Working with big datasets
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

In the development of large datasets, it is advisable to create an index as small as possible to optimize the implementation process
of the dataset loader and pass the tests.


Working with remote indexes
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

For the end-user there is no difference between the remote and local indexes. However, indexes can get large when there are a lot of tracks
in the dataset. In these cases, storing and accessing an index remotely can be convenient. Large indexes can be added to REMOTES, 
and will be downloaded with the rest of the dataset. For example:

.. code-block:: python

    "index": download_utils.RemoteFileMetadata(
        filename="acousticbrainz_genre_index.json.zip",
        url="https://zenodo.org/record/4298580/files/acousticbrainz_genre_index.json.zip?download=1",
        checksum="810f1c003f53cbe58002ba96e6d4d138",
    )


Unlike local indexes, the remote indexes will live in the ``data_home`` directory. When creating the ``Dataset``
object, specify the ``custom_index_path`` to where the index will be downloaded (as a relative path to ``data_home``).


.. _reducing_test_space:

Reducing the testing space usage
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

We are trying to keep the test resources folder size as small as possible, because it can get really heavy as new loaders are added. We
kindly ask the contributors to reduce the size of the testing data if possible (e.g. trimming the audio tracks, keeping just two rows for
csv files).


.. _submit_loader:

4. Submit your loader
---------------------

Before you submit your loader make sure to:

1. Add your module to ``docs/source/mirdata.rst`` following an alphabetical order
2. Add your module to ``docs/source/table.rst`` following an alphabetical order as follows:

.. code-block:: rst

    * - Dataset
      - Downloadable?
      - Annotation Types
      - Tracks
      - License

An example of this for the ``Beatport EDM key`` dataset:

.. code-block:: rst

   * - Beatport EDM key
     - - audio: ✅
       - annotations: ✅
     - - global :ref:`key`
     - 1486
     - .. image:: https://licensebuttons.net/l/by-sa/3.0/88x31.png
          :target: https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/4.0


(you can check that this was done correctly by clicking on the readthedocs check when you open a PR). You can find license
badges images and links `here <https://gist.github.com/lukas-h/2a5d00690736b4c3a7ba>`_.

Pull Request template
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

When starting your PR please use the `new_loader.md template <https://github.com/mir-dataset-loaders/mirdata/blob/master/.github/PULL_REQUEST_TEMPLATE/new_loader.md>`_,
it will simplify the reviewing process and also help you make a complete PR. You can do that by adding
``&template=new_loader.md`` at the end of the url when you are creating the PR :

``...mir-dataset-loaders/mirdata/compare?expand=1`` will become
``...mir-dataset-loaders/mirdata/compare?expand=1&template=new_loader.md``.

Docs
^^^^

Staged docs for every new PR are built, and you can look at them by clicking on the "readthedocs" test in a PR. 
To quickly troubleshoot any issues, you can build the docs locally by nagivating to the ``docs`` folder, and running 
``make html`` (note, you must have ``sphinx`` installed). Then open the generated ``_build/source/index.html`` 
file in your web browser to view.

Troubleshooting
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

If github shows a red ``X`` next to your latest commit, it means one of our checks is not passing. This could mean:

1. running ``black`` has failed -- this means that your code is not formatted according to ``black``'s code-style. To fix this, simply run
   the following from inside the top level folder of the repository:

::

    black --target-version py38 mirdata/ tests/

2. the test coverage is too low -- this means that there are too many new lines of code introduced that are not tested.

3. the docs build has failed -- this means that one of the changes you made to the documentation has caused the build to fail. 
   Check the formatting in your changes and make sure they are consistent.

4. the tests have failed -- this means at least one of the tests is failing. Run the tests locally to make sure they are passing. 
   If they are passing locally but failing in the check, open an `issue` and we can help debug.


Documentation
#############

This documentation is in `rst format <https://docutils.sourceforge.io/docs/user/rst/quickref.html>`_.
It is built using `Sphinx <https://www.sphinx-doc.org/en/master/index.html>`_ and hosted on `readthedocs <https://readthedocs.org/>`_.
The API documentation is built using `autodoc <https://www.sphinx-doc.org/en/master/usage/extensions/autodoc.html>`_, which autogenerates
documentation from the code's docstrings. We use the `napoleon <https://www.sphinx-doc.org/en/master/usage/extensions/napoleon.html>`_ plugin
for building docs in Google docstring style. See the next section for docstring conventions.


mirdata uses `Google's Docstring formatting style <https://google.github.io/styleguide/pyguide.html#s3.8-comments-and-docstrings>`_.
Here are some common examples.

.. note::
    The small formatting details in these examples are important. Differences in new lines, indentation, and spacing make
    a difference in how the documentation is rendered. For example writing ``Returns:`` will render correctly, but ``Returns``
    or ``Returns :`` will not. 


Functions:

.. code-block:: python

    def add_to_list(list_of_numbers, scalar):

        You can write a continuation of the function description here on the next line.

        You can optionally write more about the function here. If you want to add an example
        of how this function can be used, you can do it like below.

        Example:

Loading from files

We use the following libraries for loading data from files:

+=========================+=============+
| audio (wav, mp3, ...)   | librosa     |

Track Attributes
----------------
Custom track attributes should be global, track-level data.
For some datasets, there is a separate, dataset-level metadata file
with track-level metadata, e.g. as a csv. When a single file is needed
for more than one track, we recommend using writing a ``_metadata`` cached property (which
returns a dictionary, either keyed by track_id or freeform)
in the Dataset class (see the dataset module example code above). When this is specified,
it will populate a track's hidden ``_track_metadata`` field, which can be accessed from
the Track class.

For example, if ``_metadata`` returns a dictionary of the form:

.. code-block:: python

    {
        'track1': {
            'artist': 'A',
            'genre': 'Z'
        },
        'track2': {
            'artist': 'B',
            'genre': 'Y'
        }
    }

the ``_track metadata`` for ``track_id=track2`` will be:

.. code-block:: python

    {
        'artist': 'B',
        'genre': 'Y'
    }


Load methods vs Track properties
--------------------------------
Track properties and cached properties should be trivial, and directly call a ``load_*`` method.
There should be no additional logic in a track property/cached property, and instead all logic
should be done in the load method. We separate these because the track properties are only usable
when data is available locally - when data is remote, the load methods are used instead.

Missing Data
------------
If a Track has a property, for example a type of annotation, that is present for some tracks and not others,
the property should be set to `None` when it isn't available.

The index should only contain key-values for files that exist.

Custom Decorators
#################

cached_property
---------------
This is used primarily for Track classes.

This decorator causes an Object's function to behave like
an attribute (aka, like the ``@property`` decorator), but caches
the value in memory after it is first accessed. This is used
for data which is relatively large and loaded from files.

docstring_inherit
-----------------
This decorator is used for children of the Dataset class, and
copies the Attributes from the parent class to the docstring of the child.
This gives us clear and complete docs without a lot of copy-paste.

copy_docs
---------
This decorator is used mainly for a dataset's ``load_`` functions, which
are attached to a loader's Dataset class. The attached function is identical,
and this decorator simply copies the docstring from another function.

coerce_to_bytes_io/coerce_to_string_io
--------------------------------------
These are two decorators used to simplify the loading of various `Track` members
in addition to giving users the ability to use file streams instead of paths in
case the data is in a remote location e.g. GCS. The decorators modify the function
to:

- Return `None` if `None` if passed in.
- Open a file if a string path is passed in either `'w'` mode for `string_io` or `wb` for `bytes_io` and
  pass the file handle to the decorated function.
- Pass the file handle to the decorated function if a file-like object is passed.

This cannot be used if the function to be decorated takes multiple arguments.
`coerce_to_bytes_io` should not be used if trying to load an mp3 with librosa as libsndfile does not support
`mp3` yet and `audioread` expects a path.
