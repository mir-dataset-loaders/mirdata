Introduction
============

This library provides tools for working with common MIR datasets, including tools for:

 * downloading datasets to a common location and format
 * validating that the files for a dataset are all present
 * loading annotation files to a common format, consistent with the format required by `mir_eval`
 * parsing track level metadata for detailed evaluations.

This libary was presented in our `ISMIR 2019 paper <https://magdalenafuentes.github.io/publications/2019_ISMIR_mirdata.pdf>`_

To install, run:
``pip install mirdata``

For more details see the :ref:`tutorial`.

Reproducability
---------------
Everyone uses the same dataset
If mistakes found, can fix and still compare algorithms
Easy to use multiple datasets, increase multi-tasking and diversity of musical cultures

Standardization
---------------
Standardize while respecting idiosyncrasy of datasets
