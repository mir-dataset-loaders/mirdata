``mirdata`` is an open-source Python library that provides tools for working with common Music Information Retrieval (MIR) datasets, including tools for:

 * downloading datasets to a common location and format
 * validating that the files for a dataset are all present
 * loading annotation files to a common format, consistent with ``mir_eval``
 * parsing track level metadata for detailed evaluations.


.. code-block::

    pip install mirdata


For more details on how to use the library see the :ref:`tutorial`.
