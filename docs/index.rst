`mirdata` is an open-source Python library that provides tools for working with common MIR datasets, including tools for:

 * downloading datasets to a common location and format
 * validating that the files for a dataset are all present
 * loading annotation files to a common format, consistent with the format required by `mir_eval`
 * parsing track level metadata for detailed evaluations.
