CompMusic Hindustani Music Rhythm Dataset 

http://compmusic.upf.edu/hindustani-rhythm-dataset

************
This is a rhythm annotated dataset for automatic rhythm analysis tasks in Hindustani Music. The collection consists of audio excerpts from the CompMusic Carnatic research corpus, manually annotated time aligned markers indicating the progression through the taala cycle, and the associated taala related metadata. The dataset consists of 118 pieces in four taalas of Carnatic music, with about 4 hours of audio. 

If you use this dataset in your work, please cite the following papers:

Dataset Organization: 

The dataset consists of audio and annotations. For each audio excerpt (wav), there is a corresponding annotation file  with the same file name.  The dataset is organized into folders based on different types of data (audio, annotations). 

There are the following files/folders
<rootFolder>/filelist_<meterName>.txt: List of files for each meter in the dataset

<rootFolder>/LICENSE: License file

All the audio and annotations are organized as:

Audio: 
<rootFolder>/audio/<uid>_<fname>.wav

Annotations: 
<rootFolder>/annotations/meter/<uid>_<fname>.meter: The meter of the corresponding audio file, expressed as a time signature: <Num>/<Den> where Num indicates the number of beats per cycle. 

<rootFolder>/annotations/beats/<uid>_<fname>.beats: The beat annotations are files with time-stamp (in seconds) and metrical position value pairs. A part of an annotation file for a piece with 3 beats in a measure is shown below as an example.
